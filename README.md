Antoine's dotfiles
==================

Just a bunch of dot file in order to setup/sync my working environment.


You can get some inspiration from those dotfiles. But I don't recommand to use it:

 * I remapped all of my tools for my [keyboard layout](http://www.bepo.fr)
 * Only I know every short cut on aliases

All of my customcommands are under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/)

Postinstall
===========

Some commands to run only once after install:

  $ pip install --user jedi  # for vim jedi
